# Battleship

[Check out the project here](https://tidalsana.github.io/battleship/)!

## Summary

This project was built for The Odin Project JavaScript course.
We were assigned to create the game under the fundamentals of testing parts
of our logic. Testing the ships whether or not they got hit, the placements of the ships
were valid and almost every nuance included in building a game of this size.

## Things learned

The project ended up being...well, the battleship game! Goal was to hit testing though, it helped me organize my code and check for the whole overall functionality. It is my first time doing it, but it felt very good and natural after a certain point. I am not perfect, but I feel good after all this!

Up to this point, it has topped the hardest project I have done. I love the little-to-no hand holding experience I get throughout this curriculum. It was a breeze once I finished the logic for the game and I am sure there are still bugs and little things I haven't found yet, but so far I am proud of progress and how much I've done with this.
